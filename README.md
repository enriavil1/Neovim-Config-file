# Neovim-Config-file
This contains all my neovim config

## Requirements
    1. install neovim (using homebrew `brew install neovim`)
    2. Clone this repository onto your .config folder (might work by running `git clone ~/.config`)
    3. Go to .config/neovim/lua/user/plugins.lua and run `:w` in your neovim. This will ensure the installation of packer and all the plugins.
